**Backend and API:** The backbone of the platform is built with Python, utilizing libraries such as FastAPI, NumPy, Keras, and JAX, ensuring high performance and scalability.
**Frontend:** The client-side is developed with Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, employing LightweightCharts for charting purposes. Additional modules enhance the platform's functionality. The frontend is slated for a future refactoring to modern frameworks like Vue.js and Vuetify for a more robust user interface.

**Documentation** Public docs in in progress. Some can be found on [knowledge base](trading.mujdenik.eu) but first please request access. Some analysis documents can be found on [shared google doc folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WmYG8oDGXO-lVTLVs9knAmMTmQL4dZt6?usp=drive_link).

# Installation Instructions
This document outlines the steps for installing and setting up the necessary environment for the application. These instructions are applicable for both Windows and Linux operating systems. Please follow the steps carefully to ensure a smooth setup.

## Prerequisites
Before beginning the installation process, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- TA-Lib Library:
  - Windows: Download and build the TA-Lib library. Install Visual Studio Community with the Visual C++ feature. Navigate to `C:\ta-lib\c\make\cdr\win32\msvc` in the command prompt and build the library using the available makefile.
  - Linux: Install TA-Lib using your distribution's package manager or compile from source following the instructions available on the TA-Lib GitHub repository.
 
- Alpaca Paper Trading Account: Create an account at [Alpaca Markets](https://alpaca.markets/) and generate `API_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` for your paper trading account.

## Installation Steps
**Clone the Repository:** Clone the remote repository to your local machine.
   `git clone git@github.com:drew2323/v2trading.git <name_of_local_folder>`
   
**Install Python:** Ensure Python 3.10.11 is installed on your system.

**Create a Virtual Environment:** Set up a Python virtual environment.
   `python -m venv <path_to_venv_folder>`
   
**Activate Virtual Environment:**
   - Windows: `source ./<venv_folder>/Scripts/activate`
   - Linux: `source ./<venv_folder>/bin/activate`

**Install Dependencies:** Install the program requirements.
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   Note: It's permissible to comment out references to `keras` and `tensorflow` modules, as well as the `ml-room` repository in `requirements.txt`.

**Environment Variables:** In `run.sh`, modify the `VIRTUAL_ENV_DIR` and `PYTHON_TO_USE` variables as necessary.

**Data Directory:** Navigate to `DATA_DIR` and create folders: `aggcache`, `tradecache`, and `models`.

**Media and Static Folders:** Create `media` and `static` folders one level above the repository directory. Also create `.env` file there.

**Database Setup:** Create the `v2trading.db` file using SQL commands from `v2trading_create_db.sql`.
```
    import sqlite3
    with open("v2trading_create_db.sql", "r") as f:
        sql_statements = f.read()
    conn = sqlite3.connect('v2trading.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.executescript(sql_statements)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```
Ensure the `config_table` is not empty by making an initial entry.

**Start the Application:** Run `main.py` in VSCode to start the application.

**Accessing the Application:** If the uvicorn server runs successfully at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, access the application at `http://localhost:8000/static/`.

**Database Configuration:** Add dynamic button and JS configurations to the `config_table` in `v2trading.db` via the "Config" section on the main page.
Please replace placeholders (e.g., `<name_of_local_folder>`, `<path_to_venv_folder>`) with your actual paths and details. Follow these instructions to ensure the application is set up correctly and ready for use.

## Environmental variables
Trading platform can support N different accounts. Their API keys are stored as environmental variables in .env file located in the root directory.
Account for trading api is selected when each strategy is run. However for realtime websocket data), always ACCOUNT1 is used for all strategies. The data point selection (iex vs sip) is set by LIVE_DATA_FEED environment variable.  

.env file should contain:

```
ACCOUNT1_LIVE_API_KEY=<ACCOUNT1_LIVE_API_KEY>
ACCOUNT1_LIVE_SECRET_KEY=<ACCOUNT1_LIVE_SECRET_KEY>
ACCOUNT1_LIVE_FEED=sip
ACCOUNT1_PAPER_API_KEY=<ACCOUNT1_PAPER_API_KEY>
ACCOUNT1_PAPER_SECRET_KEY=<ACCOUNT1_PAPER_SECRET_KEY>
ACCOUNT1_PAPER_FEED=sip
ACCOUNT2_PAPER_API_KEY=<ACCOUNT2_PAPER_API_KEY>
ACCOUNT2_PAPER_SECRET_KEY=ACCOUNT2_PAPER_SECRET_KEY<>
ACCOUNT2_PAPER_FEED=iex
WEB_API_KEY=<pass-for-webapi>
```
