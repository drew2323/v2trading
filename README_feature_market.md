To implement modifications made within this git branch `feature/market_attribute`, please follow these steps:
1. start python file named `update_run_manager.py` --> new column named `market` should be created in the table `run manager` and  your existing database will be changed. 
2. Use application as usual. Any new run manager record is set by default for US stock market. 


**You can also use sequence of SQL commands in `v2trading_create_db.sql` to create the SQLite database from scratch.**
